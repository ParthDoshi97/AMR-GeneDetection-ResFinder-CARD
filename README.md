# Antimicrobial gene predication using Resfinder and CARD Database
This repository contains scripts for predicting antimicrobial resistance genes using the Resfinder and CARD (Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database) databases. The Script is designed to handle multiple input files, making it suitable for batch processing of genomic data.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following tools installed:
- Resfinder
- CARD

## Installation
